              <p>
              Iâ€™m a Systems Developer and Compiler Engineer, focusing on low-level software and related technologies. 
              In cybersecurity, I work as a Pentester, addressing vulnerabilities and enhancing security. My experience 
              includes solving complex computational problems as an Algorithmic Programmer and improving AI models through 
              Prompt Engineering. I also work in Machine Learning, developing solutions involving data and models, while my background in 
              Microcontroller Programming covers various embedded systems. I apply advanced mathematics in different contexts and bring a 
              minimalistic approach to graphic design.
